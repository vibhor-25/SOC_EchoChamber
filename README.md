## Program Overview
This repository documents my learning journey as part of WNCC's Season of Codes event. Over the past two weeks, I’ve explored foundational tools, languages, and concepts essential to machine learning, particularly neural networks.

## Week 1: Foundations in Python and Data Libraries

### Tools Setup
- **Environment:** Google Colab  
- **Why Colab?** Beginner-friendly, cloud-based, integrated with tools like Gemini, and supports Jupyter Notebooks seamlessly.

### Python Basics
I completed introductory tutorials to Python, focusing on:
- Syntax, variables, and data types
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and list/dictionary operations

---

### NumPy
I explored how to work with arrays and mathematical operations using NumPy:
- Array creation and manipulation
- Broadcasting and slicing
- Mathematical functions

---

### Pandas
Learned how to analyze and manipulate structured data using Pandas:
- DataFrames and Series
- Reading and writing CSV files
- Indexing, filtering, and basic operations

---

### Matplotlib
Gained basic visualization skills:
- Line plots, bar graphs, histograms
- Labels, legends, and custom styling

---


## Week 2: Introduction to Machine Learning & Neural Networks

### Theory and Concepts
Started learning the theoretical background behind machine learning, especially neural networks.

#### Topics Covered:
- What is Machine Learning?
- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- Cost Functions and Gradient Descent
- Neural Network Architecture (forward/backward propagation)
- Activation Functions
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - basic understanding

---

## Summary and Reflections

So far, this journey has been an enriching experience:
- I’ve strengthened my programming fundamentals using Python.
- Learned key data analysis and visualization tools.
- Started diving deep into machine learning theory with a focus on neural networks.

I feel more confident working with data and excited to move towards building and training real ML models in the coming weeks!
